It's a great exercise to involve the whole team in&mdash;Project Managers, Designers, and Engineers. It enables the team to communicate deliberately with each other, helps define the scope of the project (useful for quoting and setting expectations), and heavily informs the wireframing/prototyping step. Plus it's fun to play with Post-It notes.</p>\r\n                    <p className=\"deck__text deck__text--body\">We heavily involved Humana at this stage in order to capture their goals for the project. Afterwards, we had a mock-data structure that the development team could run with to begin their architecture, and that the design team could use to start blocking out the UI.</p>\r\n                    <p className=\"deck__text deck__text--body\">We were aiming somewhere in the middle of the professional networking aspect of LinkedIn and the topic aggregation of Twitter, but with a bent towards academia and medical research.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"case-study__row knowledge-exchange__row\">\r\n                    <Picture\r\n                        path='/images/knowledge-exchange/home'\r\n                        alt='The Knowledge Exchange Feed'\r\n                        className='knowledge-exchange__full'\r\n                    />\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"deck deck--inner\">\r\n                    <h4 className=\"deck__heading deck__heading--subheading\">Key features</h4>\r\n                    <ul className=\"deck__list deck__list--inline deck__list--inline-by-3\">\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            <h5 className=\"deck__heading--minor-heading\">Professional networking</h5>\r\n                            <p className=\"deck__text deck__text--body deck__text--caption\">During signup, users self-select areas that they considered themselves experts in, and also areas which they wished to learn more.

Furthermore, the big social networks have been optimized by teams whose research capabilities far exceeded the resources available to our team.
